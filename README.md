# To reviewers

I made sure to made this code look closer to "finished" rather than simply a first draft that works.  

Code has been modularized, complex calculations are placed inside models when possible, minimal logic is placed in views.  
Added additional transaction details.
Variables renamed for easier reading and understanding.  Mainnet/Ropsten searches replaced with radio button. 
Tests created for model, new styles added, older styles deleted.
Comments cleaned up and made to be concise.
Code is fully functional on my computer / browser (Firefox).
